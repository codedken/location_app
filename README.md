# Location_app

## An app for saving locations of your choice on your device.

This project was built from a flutter course by Maximilian Schwarzmuller titled Flutter and Dart - [The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps).

It is a location app where users can take pictures of any place, select its location from the map, enter a title for the place, and save them on their device.

Though it is still under development. You can fork the repo and learn or add new features to it.
